Dugouts are synonymous with log boats and as Missourians growing up in what is an idyllic place for adventure, up and down many streams and rivers, along valleys and ridges, it made sense for us to choose Logboat as our name. A more recent historical figure whose legacy influences each of our worldviews is Mark Twain. The native people of Missouri and Twain symbolize for us the history, spirit, and sense of truth in what makes Missouri so wonderful.
